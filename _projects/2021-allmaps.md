Hundreds of thousands of digitised maps are currently accessible through [IIIF](https://iiif.io) across institutions worldwide. Traditionally, enriching this material geospatially required a complex GIS server infrastructure and creating non-IIIF derivatives (like map tiles).

The IIIF Maps Technical Specification Group is working on an extension to annotate IIIF resources with geospatial metadata. Allmaps uses this extension to create new possibilities for georeferencing, warping and exploring IIIF maps. For example, Allmaps eliminates the need for a map tile server by warping the IIIF resources in the browser using WebGL.

Allmaps is an open source project initiated by [Bert Spaan](https://bertspaan.nl) in collaboration with Delft University of Technology Library and Leiden University Libraries.
