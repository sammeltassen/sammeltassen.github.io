## Course description:

This studio will investigate architecture through the (re)production of a series of (speculative) fragments. Participants will collectively learn about concrete casting and the role of the catalogue in architectural production. We will (collectively) investigate the history of prefabricated concrete and the Villa van Waning (1898), the former office of the Van Waning concrete and contracting company. Based on this study and through a series of formal and material experiments every student will develop a new prototypical concrete prefabricated construction element. The individual pieces will collide in a new catalogue of construction elements. Employing this catalogue as a toolbox each student will design an extension for the villa according to a contemporary brief.
